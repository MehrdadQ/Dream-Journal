# Dream Journal

This is a simple dream journal which uses the user's Local Storage to save entered dream entries on the user's device.

User can click on the "Add Dream" button to open the text box. From there, they can type their dream, select the date for the entry, and click on "Submit" to add the dream to the Local Storage. Entered dreams appear below in a list.

The user can delete any dream entry and the selected dream will also be deleted from the Local Strorage.

A button at the top right gives the option to toggle between Light Mode and Night Mode.
